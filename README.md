# ATM-Sim


  A simple banking system built using Java programming language for a customer (which can either be a company or an individual) can open an account with type as
premium or non-premium, deposit money and withdraw it later. The system can also generate customer reports.

This code base was analysed using SonarCloud and code smells were fixed by applying appropriate refactoring techniques. 

The original code is available under the branch “OriginalCode” and the refactored code is available in the “master” branch.
